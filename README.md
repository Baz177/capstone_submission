# Fraud Detection Application Setup and Usage Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions to install, build, and run a Flask-based web application designed to upload CSV transaction files, detect fraudulent transactions, and allow humans verification. The application consists of a home page for file uploads (index.html), a verification page for flagged transactions (verify.html), an error page for handling issues (error.html), and a consistent styling file (styles.css).

### Prequisites

##### Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system
1. Python 3.8+
    - Download from python.org.
    - Verify installation: python --version or python3 --version.
2. pip
    - Python’s package manager, usually included with Python.
    - Verify: pip --version or pip3 --version.
3. A Text Editor
    - Recommended: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any editor of your choice.
4. Web Browser
    - Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to access the application.

### Application Structure
##### After setup, your project directory should look like this:
<pre>
Fraud-detection-app
├── static/
│   └── styles/
│       └── styles.css
├── templates/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── verify.html
│   └── error.html
├── server.py
├── fraud_model.pkl
├── requirements.txt
├── test.csv (5 files)
└── README.md
</pre> 
- static/styles/styles.css: CSS file for styling all pages.
- templates/: Directory containing HTML templates.
- server.py: Main Flask application script.
- requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.

### Installation and Setup 
##### Step 1: Create Project Directory (e.g: fraud-detection-app) 
1. Dowloand all folders and files
2. Create a directory system as above in your created folder
3. Open you terminal in the text Editor and Navigate to your folder. 
4. Ensure the directory is set up as above

##### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
    -  Windows: python -m venv venv
2. Activate it:
    - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    - macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    - You should see (venv) in your prompt.

##### Step 3: Install Dependencies
- Assuming a directory system as above
- install dependencies: run the following in the terminal *pip install -r requirments.txt*

##### Step 4: Your program is ready to run. 

### Building and Running the Application
##### Step 1: Verify Files
Ensure all files (server.py, index.html, verify.html, error.html, styles.css) are in the correct directories as shown above.

##### Step 2: Run the Application
1. Run the Flask app: 'python server.py'
2. You should see output like: 'Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)' 

##### Step 3: Access the Application
1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
3. You’ll see the "Upload Transaction Document" page.

### Using the Application
##### Step 1: Upload a CSV File
On the home page (http://127.0.0.1:5000/):
    - Click "Choose File" and select a CSV file with the following columns:  [distance_from_home, distance_from_last_transaction, ratio_to_median_purchase_price, repeat_retailer, used_chip, used_pin_number, online_order] 
    - You can upload a test file
    - Click Upload

##### Step 2: Verfy Fradulent Transations 
If the CSV is valid and contains fraudulent transactions (fraud == 1):
  - You’ll be redirected to the verification page (/verify).
  - A table displays flagged transactions 
  - For each row, select "Yes" or "No" to verify fraud.
  - Click "Submit Verifications" (Note: This route isn’t implemented here; see "Next Steps").
If no fraudulent transactions are detected:
  - You’ll see a message: "No fraudulent transactions detected."

##### Step 3: Handle Errors
If there’s an issue (e.g., no file, invalid CSV):
- You’ll see the error page with a message (e.g., "CSV missing required columns").
- Click "Return to Home" to try again.

### Troubleshooting
- 404 Errors: Ensure all routes (/, /upload) are defined in server.py.
- CSS Not Loading: Check the static/styles/styles.css path and Flask’s url_for.
- Table Misalignment: Verify table-layout: fixed in styles.css.
